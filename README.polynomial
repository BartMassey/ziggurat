The Ziggurat-based polynomial() generator has been removed
from this library, and replaced with a method that uses a
call to uniform() and a call to pow().  The Ziggurat was
subtly borked by bad math, and I can't see an easy way to
fix it.  Better to have a slow implementation than a bad
one, I think.
